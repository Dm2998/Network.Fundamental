Router 1 configuration.//
======================
Router configurations for a simple OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).

>The router enters privileged exec mode with en.
>Then, it enters the global configuration mode with conf t.
>The router sets up OSPF with process ID 10.
>The router's OSPF router ID is set to 1.1.1.1.
>It advertises three network segments into OSPF: 192.168.10.1/24, 10.1.1.1/30, and 10.1.1.5/30, all within OSPF Area 0.
>The g0/0/0 interface is marked as passive for OSPF, meaning it won't participate in OSPF updates.

Router 2 configuration.
======================

>The router's OSPF router ID is set to 2.2.2.2.
>Router 2 advertises three network segments into OSPF: 192.168.20.1/32, 10.1.1.2/32, and 10.1.1.9/32, all within OSPF Area 0.

======================

>The g0/0/0 interface is marked as passive for OSPF.
>Three interfaces are explicitly configured for OSPF: g0/0/0, s0/1/0, and s0/1/1, all within OSPF Area 0.
